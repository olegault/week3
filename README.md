The Department of Defense Modern Weapons Branch has released a  Request For Proposal and your company wants to submit a proposal.  Your company's CEO has asked your team to develop the prototype for this effort. 

### Requirements 
>- The starting activity or first screen shall be a login and password where the password is masked While the user is typing in their password. 
>
>- Once the user clicks on the login button they should be sent to a second activity that displays a greeting to the user with their username. The DOD wants a cool >image/logo in the center of that activity/screen.

>- The second page banner should have an appropriate Title.  
>
>Note:  You are not checking login and password information for this project.

The first phase of the project is to produce a working prototype for review. There are several milestones steps where you will need to get approval to move on to the next step. 

**Step 1:** develop the main activity.xml file and layout of all the views needed on the login page. Show this to your instructor. no code should be added to the kotlin file at this time 

**Step 2:** develop the second activity and layout of all the views needed on the this page. And show your instructor 

**Step 3:** develop the logic in code to allow the user to click on the log in button to get to the second activity and pass the username to that activity. Additionally logic will have to be added to the second activity show this to your instructor did not do that 

**Step 4:** initially disable the login button until both the username and password have been populated with some text. At this point the login button should be enabled and allow processing to get to the second activity.  Note: Kotlin has some String methods that can test if a String has content or not.
